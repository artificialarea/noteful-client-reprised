# Noteful Client (Reprised)

**branch: me-sync-db**

per: https://courses.thinkful.com/node-postgres-v1/checkpoint/19#assignment

NOTE: needed to clone Thinkful/tomatau repo, because I've yet to complete my own Noteful React Client App. Additional adjustments made to establish a clean-slate, so to speak:
* Renamed 'add-folder-note' branch to 'master', made default branch, and updated upstream remote's HEAD.
* Deleted legacy branches: gh-pages, implement-design-and-routing, implement-context.
* Created intial branch off new master, called 'init' for posterity.
