# Noteful Client (Reprised)
per: https://courses.thinkful.com/node-postgres-v1/checkpoint/19#assignment

<br/>

## Origin Story
Cloned from Thinkful/tomatau repo, because I've yet to complete my own Noteful React Client App =/ 

Additional adjustments made to establish a clean-slate, so to speak:
* Renamed 'add-folder-note' branch to 'master', made default branch, and updated upstream remote's HEAD.
* Deleted legacy branches: gh-pages, implement-design-and-routing, implement-context.
* Created intial branch off new master, called 'init' to retain initial state of things before divering.
